# HangmanConsoleGame (Beginners Project)
This project is my first **Hangman Game** that I developed using **C#** and my first upload to GitHub. It is a classic word guessing game where the player has to guess a secret word by entering letters. The game ends either when the word is guessed or when the player runs out of lives.
This is a simple but exciting project that helped me learn more about C# and console application development.

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list(Plan is to later implement a SQL Database).
- Guess letters or attempt to solve the word directly.
- Visual representation of a hangman with a corresponding number of remaining lives.
- Color-coded feedback for correctly and incorrectly guessed letters.
- Display of already guessed letters.
- Text animation when the game is lost ("YOU ARE DEAD").
- Plan to implement a SQL Database for future versions to store game data, words and statistics

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core
- Visual Studio or any IDE supporting C# development

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
   - git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game-csharp.git
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build and run the program. The game will start in your console window.

## Gameplay

1. You will be given a random word to guess.
2. You can guess a letter by typing it in and pressing Enter.
3. If you think you know the word, type `1` to attempt solving it.
4. The game will track your remaining lives. You lose a life for each incorrect guess.
5. If you run out of lives, the game ends, and the word is revealed.
6. If you guess the word or all the letters correctly, you win the game.
